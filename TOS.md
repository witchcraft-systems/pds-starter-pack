# Terms of Service

Last updated: 2025-10-04

## About This Service

This PDS is provided free of charge by volunteers on a best-effort basis. We do our best to keep things running smoothly, but as a volunteer-run service, we need to maintain final discretion over how the PDS is operated and moderated.

## Acceptable Use

You're welcome to use this PDS for pretty much anything, as long as you follow
these basic rules:

1. **It's legal.** Your content and activities must be legal in both Japan (where the PDS is hosted) and your own jurisdiction.
2. **Don't harm other users.** Don't do things that negatively impact other people on the network - this includes things like harassment, spam, or anything that could compromise the security or performance of the service.

If you stick to those guidelines, you're good to go!

## Data & Privacy

Here's how we handle your data:

- We have access to all data stored on the PDS, which is necessary to operate and maintain the service.
- We only use your data for operational purposes - things like backups, maintenance, troubleshooting, and keeping the PDS running.
- We do not sell your data to third parties or use it for anything other than operating the PDS.

Keep in mind that basically anything you post publicly on the network is, well, public - this TOS is specifically about how we handle data on our end.

## Account Management

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts at any time at our discretion, with or without a warning. No, we don't plan to start randomly taking down people's repos for no reason; this is needed to protect us from situations that we can't predict, like legal issues or security threats.

## Enforcement

- In most cases, if there's an issue, we'll give a warning first and work to resolve it, only suspending the account if that doesn't work.
- In some situations (like severe violations or emergencies), we may need to immediately suspend an account.
- Every situation is different, so we handle things on a case-by-case basis.

## Changes

We may update these terms from time to time as needed. We'll do our best to
announce significant changes, but it's a good idea to check back here
occasionally.

## Contact
